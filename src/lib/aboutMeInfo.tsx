  <p>
    Hey there! I&apos;m Haitar. With over 3 years of hands-on experience in both
    front-end and backend development, I&apos;ve been tinkering with websites to
    make them look good and work seamlessly. I didn&apos;t start with a formal
    education in this field; I&apos;ve learned the ropes through trial and
    error, lots of Google searches, and endless cups of coffee. My journey as a
    self-taught developer has been filled with challenges, but it&apos;s taught
    me the value of persistence and continuous learning. I&apos;ve had the
    pleasure of working with some amazing clients who&apos;ve left me glowing
    feedback.
